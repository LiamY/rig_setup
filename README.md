Rig Setup
=========

Programming Environment Configurations

Copy and paste this into the corresponding files on the machine
you are trying to setup.

At some point I'll put a script in here to do everything
automatically.

Something like:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamy/rig_setup/master/config_setup.sh | sh
```
